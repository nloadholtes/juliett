A nose plugin to help with test coverage

~~This plugin checks for files that have no coverage and adds them to the .coverage file for reporting.~~

~~While this will typically lower the overall coverage number, it actually helps increase the coverage in the
project by pointing files and modules that have no coverage at all.~~

Further testing on my part is showing that nose/coverage might already be doing this. (Of course this isn't working on the one project I would like to see missing coverage on, but what can you do. :smile: ) 

I'm suspending work on this project. Abandoning in place. Eject eject eject.
